# Expression 2 Chips Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a vast collection of Expression 2 (E2) chips for Garry's Mod, created using the Wiremod addon. Expression 2 is a scripting language that allows players to create complex contraptions and automate in-game actions. This repository includes hundreds of scripts that range from simulated weaponry and walking mechs to vehicles, aircraft, tools, and even a fully functional 3D modeler.

## Features

- **Weapons:** Scripts for various types of weapons, including guns, cannons, and more.
- **Walking Mechs:** E2 chips that create fully functional walking mechs with customizable behaviors.
- **Vehicles and Aircraft:** Scripts for creating cars, planes, helicopters, and other types of vehicles.
- **Tools:** Utility scripts that enhance gameplay and provide new functionalities.
- **3D Modeler:** A fully functional 3D modeler built with Expression 2, enabling in-game 3D hologram modeling.  Includes saving, loading, cloning, and even integrated inverse kinematics for modeling useable walking mechs.
